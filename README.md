# AdvancedDrasticforBrick

This version originates from CrossMix OS used on the TSP which is now compatible with the Trimui Brick using AnotherStockMix OS

Nothings really changed from the original just the config.json file.
With that being said if you already have the file for CrossMix, you can just replace the config.json and it should work perfectly.

Enjoy!!
